# Docs Introduction

The docs feature provides users with a way to organize Markdown files in a hierarchical format.

:::info

Check the [Docs Plugin API Reference documentation](./../../api/plugins/plugin-content-docs.md) for an exhaustive list of options.

:::

Your site's documentation is organized by four levels, from lowest to highest:

1. Individual pages.
2. Sidebars.
3. Versions.
4. Plugin instances.

The guide will introduce them in that order: starting from [how individual pages can be configured](./docs-create-doc.mdx), to [how to create a sidebar or multiple ones](./sidebar/index.md), to [how to create and manage versions](./versioning.md), to [how to use multiple docs plugin instances](./docs-multi-instance.mdx).

You can have a [Docs-only mode](./docs-only-mode.md).
